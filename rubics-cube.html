          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The rubics cube was created in 1974 by a Hungarian sculptor and teacher of architecture Ernő Rubik. It was released internationally in 1980 and immediately became a hit with children and mathematicians alike. As of 2024 over 500 million copies had been sold, making it the most sold puzzle game.</p>

          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>The classic rubics cube is made up of 26 cubies - 8 corner cubies, 12 edge cubies and 6 center cubies. The center cubies are connected in an imovable cross and are only able to spin around their axis. The faces of the cubies can have 6 different colours - same as the number of faces on the rubics cube.</p>

          <h3>Numbers</h3>
          <p>In total there are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible configurations of the rubics cube. Interestingly, you can get to any of the possible combinations from a solved state in at most 21 moves. This suggests that with an optimal algorithm you could solve any possible configuration in at most 21 moves and on average in 18 moves.</p>

          <h3>Algorithms</h3>
          <p>The rubics cube is solved using algorithms, which allow us to change only a part of the cube to a more desirable state. By repeatedly using multiple algorithms, we can manipulate the cube and change it back to its solved state. The simplest methods use only 3-8 different algorithms, but also require more moves to solve the cube. More advanced methods use more specific algorithms, which allow for a lower number of moves. The method most used by professional speed cubers is called CFOP.</p>

          <h3>Variations</h3>
          <p>Since the original rubics cube, there have been many attempts at making it harder, simpler or simply more stylish and cool.</p>
